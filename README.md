# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

To initiate the live graph, connect to the twitter API and run both programs located in files "Dash_Plot.py" and "Twitter_Stream.py".

Alternatively, I have uploaded a database file that was obtained from streaming tweets for 1 hour during the Brazil vs Mexico Fifa 2018 game. This file can be used along with the "Dash_Plot.py" file to create graphs.
